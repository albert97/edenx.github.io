_**Disclaimer.** This post is served as a summarisation of my study notes on RKHS theory [1], and classes I took on relevant topics, containing theoratical details from [1, 2] along with my interpretations directed by my personal interests on those topics. I am by no means an expert in functional analysis and spetral theory, so please feel free to point out any mistakes in the post.

In this article, we assume that $\calX$ is a locally compact Hausdorff space equipped with a positive Borel measure $\mu$. Moreover, let $\calL^2(\mu)$ be the seperable Hilbert space of real functions defined on $\calX$. We will mainly consider the spectral property of the integral operator for $k\in L^2(\calX\times\calX, \mu)$, which is defined as
$$
K(f)(x) = \int_{\calX} f(x)k(x,y)\;d\mu(x),\quad K: \calL^2(\calX) \to \calL^2(\calX)
$$
$K$ is a Hilbert-Schmidt integral operator (abbreviated as integral operator in the following) as will be seen in Section 2. For completeness, we first present a brief intro to the spectral theory of compact self-adjoint operator in Hilbert space. Then we show that the spectral theory is also applicable to the integral operator $K$ in our case. Finally, we will see how Mercer's theorem bridges spectral theory and RKHS, and finally its implication in ML.

## spectral theorem for compact operator in Hilbert space is a direct extension of spectral theory for square matrices (wiki)

**Definition 1 (Compact operator).**_Let $\calH$ be a Hilbert space and $L(\calH)$ be the set of bounded operators on $\calH$, i.e. for any $T\in L(\calH),\; T:\calH\to\calH$, its induced operator norm is finite. Then, $T$ is compact if the image of each bounded set under $T$ is relatively compact (its closure is compact)._

**Definition 2 (Self-adjoint operator).**_A bounded operator $T$ as in Definition 1 is called self-adjoint if $A^{\ast} = A$, where $A^{\ast$ is the adjoint of $A$._

<!-- Spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint in Hilbert space -->
**Theorem 1 (Thm 6.27, M.Einsiedler 2017).**_Let $\calH$ be a seperable Hilbert space, and $T$ a compact self-adjoint operator on $\calH$. Then there exists a sequence of real eigenvalues $\\{\lambda_n\\}_n$ with $\abs{\lambda_n}\to 0$ as $n\to\infty$; and an orthonormal basis $\\{v_n\\}_n$ of eigenvectors with $A v_n = \lambda_n v_n\; \forall n\geq 1$._

It follows directly that such $T$ is diagonalisable, and each non-zero eigenvalue has finite-multiplicity. 

<h2 class="section-heading">Mercer expansion of integral operator</h2>

We first show the integral operator $K$ defined in the beginning is indeed Hilbert-Schmidt. Recall that an operator $T$ on a seperable Hilbert space is HS if for any CONS $\\{\psi_i\\}_{i=1}^{\infty}$, 
$$
\norm{T}_{HS}^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\norm{T\psi_i}^2 < \infty.
$$
Therefore, by Parseval's identity we have $k(x,\cdot) = \sum_i \inner{k(x,\cdot), \psi_i}_{\calL^2} \psi_i$, then
\begin{equation*}
\begin{align}
\int \abs{k(x,y)}^2 \;dy 
&= \inner{k(x, \cdot), k(x, \cdot)}_{\calL^2}\\
&= \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\abs{\inner{k(x,\cdot), \psi_i}_{\calL^2}}^2 \\
&=\sum_{i=1} \abs{\int k(x,y)\psi_i(y) \;dy}^2\\
&=\sum_{i=1} \abs{K(\psi_i)(x)},
\end{align}
\end{equation*}
integrate w.r.t $x$ gives
$$
\int\int \abs{k(x,y)}^2 \;dydx  = \sum_i \norm{K\psi_i}_{\calL^2}^2 = \norm{K}_{HS}^2.
$$
Since $k\in \calL^2(\calX\times\calX, \mu)$, the term on the RHS is bounded. Then we complete the proof. Interestinhly, for any HS operator $T$ on seperable $\calL^2(\calX, \mu)$, there is a square integrable function $k_T\in \calL^2(\calX\times\calX, \mu)$ such that $T$ can be written in the form as $K$ [4]. Furthermore, we will see that the HS-integral operator is compact and self-adjoint.

**Proposition 1 (Hilbert-Schmidt, M.Einsiedler 2017).**_Let $(\calX, \calB_{\calX}, \mu)$, $(\calY, \calB_{\calY}, \nu)$ be $\sigma$-finite measure spaces. Let $k\in \calL^2(\calX \times\calY, \mu\times\nv)$. Then the Hilbert-Schmidt integral operator $K:\calL^2(\calX, \mu)\to \calL^2(\calY, \nu)$ defined by 
$$
K(f)(y) = \int_{\calX} f(x)k(x,y)\;d\mu(x)
$$
for $\nu$-almost everywhere $y\in\calY$ defines a compact operator._

In addition, $K$ in Proposition 1 is also continuous thus bounded [3], and it is self-adjoint as long as $k(x,y) = k(y,x)$. Clearly, Proposition 1 applies to our integral operator $K\in L^2(\calX\times\calX, \mu)$; with the assumption that $\calL^2$ is a seperable Hilbert space, $K$ admits a set of non-zero eigenvalues $\\{\lambda_j\\}_j$ and eigenvectors $\\{\phi_j\\}_j$. Moreover, by the property of Hilbert-Schmidt operator, we have that $K = \sum_{i}\lambda_i (\phi_i \otimes \phi_i)$, which can be seen as a generalisation to eigen-decomposition [4].

We will see that for positive definite quadratic form (condition 2 in Theorem 2), operator $K$ has positive eigenvalues. We present here a modification of Mercer's theorem in [1] to accommodate the setting given in the beginning, however, it can be shown to apply to a more general scenario.

**Theorem 2 (Mercer's theorem, S.Saitoh 2016).**_For $\mu$ and $\calX$ defined previously, assume $k$ satisfies the following assumptions:
1. $k(x,y) = k(y,x)\;\forall x,y\in\supp{\mu}$;
2. \int\int_{\calX\times\calX} k(x,y)f(x)f(y)\;d\mu(y) \geq 0, \;\forall f\in\calL^2(\calX, \mu).
Then $K$ admits a set of positive eigenvalues and corresponding orthonomorl eigenfunctions, where $K = \sum_{i}\lambda_i (\phi_i \otimes \phi_i)$, where the convergence is absolute and uniform on $\supp{\mu\times\mu}$._

Since condition 2 is equivalent to the definition of positive definite quadratic form, Mercer's theorem is generally applicable to all reproducing kernels in Part 1.

<h2 class="section-heading">Construction of RKHS from a spectral perspective</h2>

Finally, as a consequence of Theorem 2, we present the explicit expression of RKHS using the eigendecomposition of the integral operator (which clearly is a CONS). 

**Theorem 3 (Thm 18, K.Fukumizu 2010).**_Under the same notation, we have a RKHS with $k$ s.t.
**
H_k = \\{f\in\calL^2(\calX, \mu): 
f = \sum_i^{\infty} a_i \phi_i, \; 
\norm{f}_{H_k}^2 = \sum_i^{\infty} \frac{\abs{a_i}^2}{\lambda_i}<\infty\\},
**
and that the inner product of RKHS is of the form
$$
\inner{f, g}_{H_k} = \sum_i^{\infty} \frac{a_i b_i}{\lambda_i}
$$
where $f = \sum_i^{\infty} a_i \phi_i, \, g = \sum_i^{\infty} b_i \phi_i$, and $a_i, b_i = 0$ for $\lambda_i=0$._

Note that $k(x,x) = \sum_i^{\infty}\lambda_i \phi_i(x)^2<\infty$ by Mercer's theorem, so that $k(x,\cdot) = \sum_i^{\infty} \lambda_i \phi_i(x)\phi_i(\cdot) \in H_k$. The reproducing property follows directly:
$$
\inner{f, k(x,\cdot)}_{H_k} = \sum_i^{\infty} \frac{\lambda_i^2 \phi_i(x)}{\lambda_i} = f(x).
$$
We end with a remark on the implications of this expression of RKHS.
**Remark 1.**_ We can observe that dividing each element of $\ell^2$ inner product by $\lambda_i$ gives $\inner{\cdot, \cdot}_{H_k}$. This in effect imposes a smoothness condition on $H_k$, in the sense that for $f = \sum_i^{\infty} a_i \phi_i$ to be in $H_k$, $a_i$ must go to zero fast enough so that $\norm{f}_{H_k} = \sum_i^{\infty} a_i^2/\lambda_i <\infty$._
